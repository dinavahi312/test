Below is a 2026MY luxury 3‑row SUV “space envelope” baseline (US-market spec sheets), focused on the two metrics you asked to operationalize:
	•	Legroom for Row 1 / Row 2 / Row 3 (inches)
	•	Cargo volume behind Row 3 / behind Row 2 / max behind Row 1 (cubic feet)

I’m using the most consistently comparable sources available (primarily Car and Driver spec pages, plus OEM specs where needed). Reality check: 3rd‑row legroom and cargo can swing based on second-row fore/aft position (and captain’s chairs vs bench), so treat this as a fit-gap screening dataset, not the final contract—final validation should be against the exact VIN/Monroney for the configuration you’re buying.

Portfolio-level takeaways (aka: what pops in the data)

If your KPI is “usable 3rd row + meaningful cargo behind it”:
	•	Jeep Grand Wagoneer L is basically the cargo logistics platform of this set: 42.6 ft³ behind Row 3 is wild.
	•	Grand Wagoneer (standard wheelbase) and Escalade IQ also keep a serious luggage buffer with Row 3 upright.

If your KPI is “adult-tolerable 3rd row legroom”:
	•	The biggest 3rd-row legroom numbers in this dataset show up on Navigator, GX, Grand Wagoneer/L, Range Rover LWB, GLS.  ￼
	•	Practical caveat: legroom metrics are sensitive to where Row 2 is set; treat these as published spec values, not a guarantee of adult comfort for every seating layout.

Mid-size luxury crossovers (best “enterprise family” compromise):
	•	Lexus TX is strong on both 3rd-row legroom and cargo, relative to footprint.
	•	BMW X7 and GLS are the “executive shuttle” archetypes: premium cabin, generally more credible 3rd rows than MDX/Q7/QX60.  ￼

Notes on comparability and governance
	•	Cargo volume is the biggest source of “apples vs. slightly different apples” because measurement standards differ (and some OEMs measure to roof vs. window line). I kept it consistent by anchoring to the same type of spec tables wherever possible (Car and Driver, OEM spec sheets).
	•	Seating configuration matters: some of these spec pages are for 6-seat captain’s-chair setups (still 3 rows) vs 7-seat bench. That can shift row-by-row packaging slightly. (Example: XC90 and QX60 pages shown as 6-seat.)

Coverage gaps

There are other 2026 “luxury-ish” 3-row or optional-3rd-row SUVs on the market, but row-by-row legroom + row-by-row cargo volumes aren’t always published consistently in one comparable spec format across trims/configurations. Rather than inject noise, I kept the table to models where the data is cleanly attributable.

If you’re doing a full procurement-grade decision matrix, the usual next layer would be: Cadillac Escalade (gas/ESV), BMW X5 (3rd row optional), Mercedes GLE/GLB (3rd row optional), and premium EVs like Rivian R1S / Tesla Model X / Volvo EX90 / Cadillac Vistiq—but those require a second pass with configuration-specific spec sources to avoid bogus comparisons.

⸻

If you want to make this “board-ready,” the next move is to convert the table into a scored fit matrix (weights for Row‑3 legroom, cargo behind Row‑3, and max cargo), then segment by mid-size vs full-size vs EV so stakeholders don’t compare a Q7 to a Grand Wagoneer L like they’re the same operating model.
