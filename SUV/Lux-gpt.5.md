# 2026 Luxury 3-Row SUV Space Envelope Baseline (US Market)

## 1. Scope and interpretation

1. This is a packaging-focused dataset for **2026 model-year** luxury (or luxury-adjacent premium) **3-row SUVs** sold in the US market.
2. Metrics included:
   1. **Legroom (inches)** for Row 1 / Row 2 / Row 3
   2. **Cargo volume (cubic feet)** behind Row 3 / behind Row 2 / max behind Row 1
3. Important comparability note:
   1. **Row 3 legroom** is sensitive to Row 2 fore/aft position and seatback angle.
   2. **Cargo volume** may vary by measurement standard and configuration (bench vs captain’s chairs), so treat this as a **screening baseline**, not a final procurement spec.

## 3. Portfolio-level insights (decision-useful patterns)

1. Best “Row 3 up + still have meaningful luggage” profiles:
   1. Jeep Grand Wagoneer L: **42.6 ft³ behind Row 3** (logistics-grade capacity) 
   2. Jeep Grand Wagoneer (SWB): **27.9 ft³ behind Row 3** 
   3. Cadillac Escalade IQ: **23.6 ft³ behind Row 3** 
2. Strong “adult-tolerable” Row 3 legroom (published spec values):
   1. Lincoln Navigator: **43.5 in** 
   2. Lexus GX: **37.9 in** 
   3. Jeep Grand Wagoneer / L: **36.6 in** 
   4. Range Rover LWB (7-seat): **35.8 in** 
   5. Mercedes-Benz GLS: **34.6 in** 
3. Best mid-size luxury “space efficiency” tradeoffs:
   1. Lexus TX combines strong Row 3 legroom and high cargo volumes relative to footprint. 
   2. BMW X7 and Mercedes-Benz GLS are executive-grade people movers with credible Row 3 packaging for the segment. 

## 4. Comparability and governance notes (to avoid bad decisions)

1. Configuration variance:
   1. Bench vs captain’s chairs can impact second-row sliding ranges and seat geometry.
   2. Optional third-row setups (especially in EVs) can materially change cargo behind Row 3.
2. Measurement variance:
   1. Cargo volumes may be measured to different height references (window line vs roofline) depending on source and standard.
3. Procurement-grade validation workflow:
   1. Shortlist using this baseline.
   2. Confirm the exact trim/config via OEM spec sheet or Monroney label before committing.

## 5. Coverage caveats

1. This set focuses on models where row-by-row legroom and row-by-row cargo volumes are readily comparable from consistent spec sources.
2. Some additional 3-row or optional-3rd-row “luxury-ish” SUVs may require a configuration-specific sourcing pass to avoid mixing incompatible spec methodologies.
