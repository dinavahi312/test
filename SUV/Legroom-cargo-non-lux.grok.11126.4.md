# Evaluation of Previous Output: Completeness, Accuracy, Validity, and Relevancy

Upon reviewing the previous output on 2026 non-luxury three-row SUVs using web search results as of January 01, 2026, the content is assessed as follows. The initial compilation is largely complete but misses several models commonly regarded as non-luxury three-row options, such as the Toyota Highlander, Kia Sorento, and Hyundai Santa Fe (which features an optional third row in its redesign). Accuracy is high, with specifications aligning closely to manufacturer data and expert reviews, though minor adjustments have been applied based on verified sources (e.g., updated starting prices and MPG estimates). Validity is confirmed, as the data logically corresponds to vehicle classes and performance expectations. Relevancy is strong, directly addressing the query for comprehensive comparisons without extraneous details.

The table has been expanded to include omitted models and refined for precision.
